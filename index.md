### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, Part 1 was an challenge since I was always confused about how to handle file input and output. In order to print out the name and density of the states in this project, I had to build methods that dealt with an object-oriented class and read input from a CVS file.

* Lab 10 

    Lab 10, part 2 was a fascinating project because I was able to create a program that store every county's name and population into a 2D vector. When the user enters the county index, my program will return the accurate county population.  It was excellent practice utilizing the program to resolve problems in the real world.

* Lab 12 

    Lab 9 part 1 was one of my favorite because because I always want to construct some program to read word from a file. I was able to write a program in this project that can read some dictionary files and store each word as a vector.
